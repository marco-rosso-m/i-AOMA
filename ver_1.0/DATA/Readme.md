# Note

The file `nodes_mode_shape_dofs.txt` have to be similar to `nodes.txt` with same shape, and with 0 or 1 depending on the monitored dofs in the vibration data file `5DOF_fixed_ex.txt`. This file connects the mode shape dofs to the corresponding dofs of the base model, plotted according to the given nodes and connectivity matrix.
